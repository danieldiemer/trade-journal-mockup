# Trade Journal Mockup
--Indefinitely incomplete.  

I got far enough into this project to realize there was something already built (Godot Engine) that already has in place a lot of what I was trying to accomplish. 

I'll continue this project using Godot game engine, a has a lot of features that results in less setup from me.

This project is based on the idea that got me started wanting to develop software.  I didn't like any of the existing
trade journals, mostly because they cost upwards of $50 per month, but was frustrated with not 
being able to do exactly what I wanted.

This project is basically a test idea, to get the format of inputting trades down, the questions I want.

It will be lacking in features, namely there will be no database for storing data, but will be good at developing the
type of program I want.

The basic idea is to enter these trades with comments and thoughts while in progress.  Like why did you enter, what is
strategy etc.  These thoughts are lost later in the day.  This is not a high frequency trading app, so there will be
no importing of entry prices or stats via CSV after the fact as that kind of defeats the purpose.

This app is meant to help plan strategies, check things off prior to entry, and compare strategy and trade metrics over
long term to say whether or not something is profitable. There are no similar applications that exist which I could find.
